{"name":"High-Performance Computing using Campus Cluster","tagline":"","body":"## Introduction to HPC\r\nThis short course will introduce you to the basic practical principles of high-performance computing (HPC) using the University of Illinois Campus Cluster.  Topics will include MPI, the job queue, the module system, and other aspects those new to cluster computing need to navigate and deploy their programs.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to parallel programming, nor is it intended to replace courses such as CS 420 which introduce parallel programming concepts.  We will discuss aspects of MPI and OpenMP programming, but this course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which engineering students and researchers may encounter.\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\nWe will use the [Etherpad](http://meetingwords.com/ehlagqUook) to share complicated snippets of code and text during class.  The Post-It notes are to indicate either your completion of a task (green) or your need of assistance (pink).\r\n\r\n## First Section (12–13 March)\r\n\r\n## Second Section (19–20 March)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
